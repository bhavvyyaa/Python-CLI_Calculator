# Python CLI Calculator

A robust and user-friendly command-line calculator built with Python.
This project was developed as part of the Elevate Labs Python Developer Internship Task 1. It goes beyond the basic requirements by incorporating advanced features and a modern, attractive user interface.

##  Features

* **Continuous Calculation:** Allows for consecutive operations on the result of the previous calculation.
* **Comprehensive Operations:** Supports a wide range of functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and square roots.
* **Intuitive Interface:** The calculator menu is presented clearly and uses colored output for better readability, powered by the `rich` library.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The program gracefully handles invalid inputs, such as division by zero, non-numeric entries, and invalid choices, preventing crashes and providing helpful feedback.
* **Memory Functionality:** Users can clear the current calculation at any time by typing 'C'.
* **Exit Functionality:** A clear option to exit the application is provided.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

You need **Python** installed on your system. This project also requires the `rich` library to run with the enhanced console features.

Install `rich` using pip:
```bash
pip install rich
